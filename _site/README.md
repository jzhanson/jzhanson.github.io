# jzhanson.github.io

Personal website for Josh Zhanson, served over GitHub Pages. Work in progress!

## TODO

- [x] Serve through GitHub Pages [[basics](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/)]
- [x] UDPATE: They are advanced features - nice to have after core website is up and running - can make life easier but not worth getting hung up on right now. Figure out what [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/guide) are and how they works with Node, Ruby, etc.
- [x] UPDATE: Useful for organizing HTML/CSS classes, etc, probably worth exploring before Jade and Sass. What is [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)?
- [x] Configure CNAME to work with custom domain, guide [here](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/)
- [ ] Get some cool website design up and running
- [ ] Make blog work with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/) (with [octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress)?)
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Profit!!!
